# Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 + Yuri's Revenge — Apple Silicon Mac, iPhone & iPad

An Apple Silicon macOS app is now available alongside the iPhone/iPad port.
It targets macOS 14 or later and runs the existing web engine in a native
ARM64 AppKit/WKWebView shell. See the [macOS build guide](docs/MACOS.md)
for setup, retail icons, controls, troubleshooting, and campaign limitations.

For campaign development, start with the [agent implementation guide](docs/CAMPAIGN_AGENT_GUIDE.md),
[mission-one status](docs/CAMPAIGN_MISSION_ONE.md), and
[mission two and the transition](docs/CAMPAIGN_MISSION_TWO.md).

**Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge skirmish running natively on iPhone and
iPad** — fully in English, with touch controls built for RTS (tap-select,
drag-box, two-finger map grab, pinch zoom, long-press force-attack),
mid-match save/load, retail-accurate lighting, and skirmish AI built out on top of Supalosa's
Chrono Divide bot until you get a different opponent every match: per-match personalities ×
strategic doctrines, the retail game's own 132 attack teams, superweapons
fired like the original AI fired them, spies, garrisons, terror drones, and a roster that shifts every game.

No emulation, and no rewrite either: this is the real Chrono Divide-lineage
TypeScript engine, with its core simulation loop and determinism model left
alone and the changes additive, wrapped in a native Swift shell. Rendering flows WebGL → ANGLE → Metal via WebKit; your retail game
assets ship inside the app bundle and never touch the network.

**No game assets are included or distributed.** You need your own copy of
Red Alert 2 + Yuri's Revenge ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2229850/),
part of the C&C Ultimate Collection). One script imports everything from
your install:

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh /path/to/your/ra2/install
```

## Why this port is shaped differently than Generals

The sibling project ([Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad](https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad))
ports EA's released C++ engine: real engine, ARM64 compile, DXVK→MoltenVK
underneath. **RA2 has no released engine source.** EA opened Tiberian Dawn and
Red Alert 1 alongside the Remastered Collection in 2020, then in February 2025
released the recovered originals plus Renegade and Generals — all under GPL v3
*with EA's additional terms*, which is why GitHub classifies them as "Other"
rather than plain GPL-3.0. No RA2 engine in either release. (EA has published
the RA2/Tiberian Sun *mission editor* under GPL-3.0, which is not the same
thing.) The engine source is widely believed lost, though that traces to
community accounts rather than any statement from EA.

So there is no engine source to compile. The other route — x86 emulation of the
retail binary, the way CnCNet-under-Wine works — is a non-starter on iOS.

What exists instead is a from-scratch reimplementation: Chrono Divide, rebuilt
over years into a deterministic TypeScript sim + Three.js renderer, continued
by the RA2WEB community. So the Generals playbook still applies — *preserve
the battle-tested engine, swap the platform underneath it* — but the
translation layer is different:

| Generals port | This port |
|---|---|
| Real 2003 C++ engine, untouched | Real Chrono Divide-lineage TS engine, untouched where it counts |
| DX8 → DXVK → Vulkan → MoltenVK → Metal | WebGL → ANGLE → Metal (Apple ships this in WebKit, JIT included) |
| Filesystem rerouted into the bundle | Assets bundled + first-launch seed into origin storage, self-healing |
| SDL touch → RTS touch semantics | Custom gesture engine → the engine's pointer layer |
| "iOS owns your process" lifecycle work | Same, via the shell owning the WebView lifecycle |

And where the Generals engine came with its AI, its lighting, and its
expansion content built in, here each of those became its own campaign —
which is where most of the story below happened.

## The story of the effort

The engine ran in a desktop browser on day one. Everything between that and
"a full RA2+YR experience that plays great on an iPad" was the actual work.
In rough chronological order:

### Making it a product
- **English, all the way down.** The fork was Chinese. In-game strings turned
  out to be 99.98% recoverable from the retail English `ra2.csf` (one key was
  a translator credit); ~38 source files of UI/comments/dev-tools were
  translated by hand.
- **A native shell with zero network dependency.** Custom URL-scheme handler
  serving the built app and ~750MB of game assets from the bundle (the Yuri's Revenge build; RA2-classic is ~400MB);
  first-launch seeding into browser origin storage that verifies per-file and
  self-heals when iOS purges storage under disk pressure.
- **Touch controls that feel like an RTS**, not a webpage: one-finger
  tap/drag-box, two-finger 1:1 map grab, pinch zoom (which meant *unlocking
  camera zoom in the engine* and making pan limits zoom-aware), long-press
  force-attack, and cancelled touches that never ghost-click.
- **Native-resolution rendering** (logical UI scale × devicePixelRatio into
  the WebGL backing store) so an iPad mini renders the battlefield at
  2560×1440 instead of an upscaled 1280×720 — which surfaced input-mapping
  and shroud-seam bugs that only exist at fractional scales.
- **Mid-match save/load**, built on the engine's replay system: a save is the
  action log up to the saved tick; loading resimulates it deterministically
  at maximum speed and hands control back. This forced a real determinism
  audit (an RNG seed was silently losing millisecond precision in a
  round-trip through the save format).

### Making it Yuri's Revenge
The engine had YR scaffolding but booted RA2-only. Getting to a **fully
playable third faction** took three phases: engine-mode plumbing and md-asset
import; the slave-miner economy (the faction's core loop — slaves, grinder,
bio reactor occupancy power); and the exotics — Mastermind mind-control capacity (retail's
overload self-damage is not modelled), Magnetron vehicle lifting, Tank Bunkers, Cloning Vats, Psychic
Dominator and Genetic Mutator superweapons, Battle Fortress open-topped fire (proxied as the strongest
passenger's weapon at a scaled rate, not five passengers firing), Robot Tanks with a live control-center dependency, Boris airstrikes,
berserk gas. Plus the YR-specific crash archaeology: the retail `rulesmd.ini`
*omits* ~25 `[AudioVisual]` keys that the YR binary hardcodes — the first
move order in any YR game was a fatal crash until the engine learned the
retail defaults.

### Making it look right
A 26-agent audit compared every asset and lighting path against retail
seeded archives byte-identical to Steam, VXL parsing byte-equal to the
CNCMaps reference implementation (not to the retail binary, which nothing here
was compared against), all four voxel normal tables exact. The audit also
found real divergences, all fixed: map `[Lighting]` ground term applied with
the wrong sign, palette lighting multiplied in the wrong color domain (now
exact gamma-domain math in the shaders), voxel shading rebuilt to the retail
`palette × (0.8 + 1.3·dotNL) × cell light` model, invisible lamp buildings
that should cast light without rendering (the source of YR's famous
white-washed city blocks), and per-country loading-screen palettes (YR
repainted every one; the engine was using the RA2 palette — hence the
"16-bit-looking" load screens).

### Making the AI worth playing
The centerpiece, and the longest fight in the project. The stock bot idled
behind three war factories, rushed the same conscripts every game, and once
built twenty bio reactors. Five research-driven passes built the systems —
and then a sixth pass discovered that several of them had never actually
been running:

1. **Diagnosis + the retail database.** The root causes were structural (army
   units were only ever built when an attack mission requested them). The fix
   came with a gift: the retail `aimd.ini` — 132 TaskForces, 165
   AITriggerTypes — parsed and wired in as the attack-team library, with
   conditions ("enemy owns ≥1 battle lab"), per-difficulty enables, and
   outcome-weight feedback. Even the upstream bot project had this on its
   wishlist.
2. **Superweapons + squad brains.** A superweapon officer that fires nukes,
   storms and dominators at the enemy's most valuable cluster, iron-curtains
   its own armored push, chronoshifts vehicle squads, answers *your* launches
   with Force Shield at retail's 90/50/10% by difficulty, and paradrops into
   ongoing fights. Squads learned to retreat from lost fights (distilled from
   OpenRA's attack-or-flee fuzzy logic), artillery holds stand-off range,
   attacks arc in on center/flank/backdoor lanes.
3. **No two skirmishes the same.** Per-match rolls: 6 personalities × 5
   doctrines × an opening book × ±40% production-weight jitter × a mask that
   benches a quarter of the attack-team deck each game. Country identity
   (Iraq fields Desolators, Cuba terrorists, France Grand Cannons, Korea
   Black Eagles). ~20 missing units and 6 missing buildings entered the
   roster with micro-roles so specialists fight correctly — terror drones
   hunt vehicles, commandos C4 buildings, demo trucks trade themselves for
   structures. A counter-composition census answers what *you* build.
4. **EA's own source code.** With RA1's `HOUSE.CPP` Expert AI and Generals'
   skirmish AI open-sourced, the actual retail values replaced guesses:
   trigger feedback at true retail strength (+20/−50 with the track-record
   snowball), superweapon targeting from the real `AIIonCannon` value tables,
   fire-on-ready timing, per-difficulty defense caps (easy AIs are nearly
   undefended — that's what makes them beatable), the ±80% census misjudgment
   that makes easy bots build wrong counters, grudge-based enemy focus, and
   RA1's iconic fire-sale endgame.
5. **Backporting the learnings.** OpenRA-style leader movement (the slowest
   unit leads; pushes arrive as one fist), air discipline (flyers refuse
   AA-saturated zones; air production pivots when you wall the sky), spy
   infiltration (battle lab = stolen-tech units), Battle Fortress boarding,
   and the RA1 desperation sell-ladder.

6. **Finding out none of it was on.** A 19-agent review fixed 14 real bugs
   and made the sim 2.2× faster — and the AI still played badly on device.
   The reason is the most useful thing this project learned: **a bot that
   does nothing throws nothing.** Error-free soak tests and per-tick
   profiling both passed while large parts of the AI were inert. Three
   defects were switching it off. A lobby validator written before "Brutal"
   existed silently demoted every saved Brutal slot to Easy. A mission gate
   nested a global `tick % 3` inside a per-bot phase-offset update —
   arithmetic that, for most bots, is *never simultaneously true*, so they
   ran no missions, no attacks and no superweapons for entire matches. And a
   "failsafe" meant to unstick a dead bot queued buildings behind the real
   queue controller's back, falling through to "extra power is always
   useful" — forever. That single line is the true origin of the twenty bio
   reactors, and its queue/cancel war with the real controller burned the
   economy that should have been buying tanks.

Then a 198-agent adversarial audit went looking for the rest, and confirmed
72 findings across eleven dimensions. The pattern repeated: the same dead-gate
arithmetic had also silenced the threat model for seven bots in eight (so
defenses stopped at one of each type and nobody expanded); attack squads
disbanded on their *first* update because a no-target timer started at zero;
tech and superweapons scaled their desire by *current cash* while a healthy
bot spends to zero, so those requests never formed; the war factory kept
buying harvesters because miners outweighed tanks in the background pool;
artillery was missing from that pool entirely; and bot reaction speed was
derived from the wall clock against the game-speed slider, making every
difficulty six times more sluggish per tick at the iPad's default speed than
in the lab. Retail's hidden AI economy bonus (`AIVirtualPurifiers` — brutal
refines ore at +100%) was simply never wired.

The fix that matters most isn't in that list: **liveness is now asserted, not
assumed.** `scripts/ai-liveness-probe.js` runs a mixed-difficulty match
headlessly and fails the build if any bot stops thinking, stops forming
attack waves, never projects force away from home, spams one structure, or
accumulates queue cancels — and the iOS build script refuses `--device`
without that sign-off. Alongside it is a habit rather than a tool: watch the
game. Reveal the map, pan the camera onto each bot's base, screenshot it
minute by minute, and judge it the way a player does. Every remaining issue
in this list was found that way, not by a counter.

### Making it cool (thermally)
Frame-rate caps with the sim decoupled (60/30/uncapped graphics option,
menus hard-capped at 30fps), no framebuffer preservation, scene-graph matrix
auto-update disabled in favor of explicit updates, octree re-slotting only on
tile changes — the earlier performance pass that took total frame CPU to
~3.6ms, which the AI work then had to respect (and did — see the numbers
above).

Then the iPad still ran hot, and CPU profiling said the wrong thing: rendering
at one-eighth the pixels saved only 5% of frame CPU. The GPU does its work
asynchronously, so the bytes it drags through DRAM — the term that actually
dominates power on a tile-based mobile GPU — never show up in a
`performance.now()` delta. Measuring bytes instead found that the sprite
batches were drawing all 10,000 preallocated slots every frame at 2.4%
occupancy, the shadow map covered 233 tiles for a 31-tile view, every sprite
atlas was RGBA8 carrying a single payload byte, and the palette shader ran
nine `pow()` per fragment computing the identity function. Fixing those took
the two biggest buffer terms about 5.7x lower, with shadows that are sharper rather than degraded (the shadows are *sharper*: refitting the box from a fixed 233-tile square to
the visible rect plus a caster margin gives ~2.4x finer texels even at a
quarter the map size). The shell now also reports `ProcessInfo.thermalState` to the
page, so the renderer — never the simulation — throttles itself when iOS says
the device is under thermal stress.

**→ The complete engineering log: [docs/PORTING_PLAYBOOK.md](docs/PORTING_PLAYBOOK.md)**

Like the Generals port, this is a **human + AI collaboration**: the
engineering was done with AI — see [AI-USE.md](AI-USE.md) for which model did
what — directed and playtested by a human who
described symptoms like *"tapping the MCV won't detect the touch"* and *"one
of the Yuri AIs just made like 20 bio reactors"* and owned every decision.

## Quick start

Prerequisites (one time):

```sh
xcode-select --install                  # plus full Xcode for device builds
brew install xcodegen ffmpeg
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Clone and run the setup script against your own install:

```sh
git clone <this-repo> ra2-ios && cd ra2-ios
./scripts/setup.sh "/path/to/steamapps/common/Command & Conquer Red Alert 2"
```

The script installs dependencies, verifies your retail files, imports and
converts the assets (nothing is downloaded — everything comes from your
copy), and tells you what to run next:

```sh
bash scripts/build-macos.sh             # Apple Silicon Mac (macOS 14+)
./scripts/build-ios.sh                  # build + iPhone simulator
RA2_TEAM_ID=<your-team-id> ./scripts/build-ios.sh --device   # iPhone/iPad
```

Find your team id in Xcode → Settings → Accounts. Install the device build
with `xcrun devicectl device install app --device <id> <path to RA2.app>`.

Desktop development (no Xcode needed):

```sh
cd redalert2 && RA2_HTTP=1 bun run dev
# open http://localhost:4000/?shell=1  ← exercises the exact iOS boot path
```

## What's upstream and what isn't

This repo's history starts from the vendored engine, so the split is verifiable
against upstream directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/huangkaoya/redalert2 /tmp/upstream
git -C /tmp/upstream checkout 8c07f10
diff -rq /tmp/upstream/src redalert2/src | wc -l
```

| | lines | whose |
|---|---|---|
| `redalert2/**` (engine, 1,300 files) | ~127,000 | Chrono Divide → RA2WEB → [huangkaoya/redalert2](https://github.com/huangkaoya/redalert2) @ `8c07f10` |
| `redalert2/src/game/ai/thirdpartbot/**` | 7,367 upstream + ~4,400 here | [Supalosa's bot](https://github.com/Supalosa/supalosa-chronodivide-bot) — **no licence declared**, see Licence |
| `ios/**` (Swift shell) | 444 lines of Swift | this repo |
| `scripts/**` (import, build, probes) | ~2,600 | this repo |

Most of the port work is not in those two directories. Roughly 9,800 of the
insertions land *inside* `redalert2/**` — Yuri's Revenge, the lighting fixes,
touch controls and the AI all modify the engine tree rather than sitting beside
it. The row above assigns that tree to upstream because upstream wrote the
127,000 lines it started from, not because nothing was added to it.
| `docs/`, `README` | ~1,200 | this repo |

On the English: the in-game strings are not translated by anyone here — they
are extracted verbatim from the retail English `language.mix` by
`scripts/prepare-gameres.ts`, i.e. Westwood's own text. The translation work in
this repo is the source tree: ~680 lines of Chinese across 35 files, plus the
UI plumbing to select the English tables.

See [AI-USE.md](AI-USE.md) for which AI models were used and on what.

## Licence

GPL-3.0, inherited from the upstream engine. The full text is in `LICENSE`.

The chain has a weak link and it is better to state it than to be told it.
Upstream `huangkaoya/redalert2` ships GPL-3.0, but its own README says all rights
belong to Chrono Divide's author, who has never open-sourced the engine. A
licensor who says the rights are someone else's cannot make a GPL grant stick,
so treat that grant as unverified rather than settled. This repository exists at
Alexandru Ciucă's sufferance and comes down the day he asks.

Two related gaps, stated rather than buried:

- The skirmish AI derives from **Supalosa's Chrono Divide bot**, which declares
  no licence at all (`"license": "UNLICENSED"` in both package manifests, no
  LICENSE file). His README invites forks, but that is not a grant. Used here
  pending an explicit licence from him.
- Vendored third-party components and their notices are listed in
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

**No built binary is distributed here, and none will be.** GPL-3.0 §6's
Installation Information requirement cannot be satisfied under iOS code signing,
so this ships as source you build with your own signing identity.

Per EA's [C&C modding guidelines](https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered/news/modding-faq),
this project is free, non-commercial, and carries their required notice:
*EA has not endorsed and does not support this product.*

## Lineage & credits

This project stands on a chain of remarkable work, and this time we want to
name all of it:

**The engine lineage**
- **[Chrono Divide](https://chronodivide.com)** by **Alexandru Ciucă** — the
  from-scratch RA2 engine reimplementation this all descends from: a
  deterministic, faithful RA2 simulation built in TypeScript over many
  years. Never open-sourced by its author; see the disclaimer below.
- **[RA2WEB](https://www.ra2web.com)** — the authorised Chinese-language
  operation of the official client, which contributed the Chinese translation
  and a mobile control panel back upstream. Not a fork: Chrono Divide has been
  under continuous development by its author throughout.
- **[huangkaoya/redalert2](https://github.com/huangkaoya/redalert2)** — the
  React + Three.js refactor this repo builds on directly.

**The AI's teachers**
- **[Supalosa's Chrono Divide bot](https://github.com/Supalosa/supalosa-chronodivide-bot)**
  (**no licence declared** — see Licence) — the foundation of the skirmish AI: missions, squads, threat maps,
  and the scaffolding everything else was built into. Several fixes from its
  newer branches (force-attack on disguised units, ammo gating, action
  cooldowns) were ported back in.
- **[OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA)** (GPL-3.0) — the squad-state
  designs our combat micro learned from: the attack-or-flee evaluation,
  leader-based squad movement, and the air-squad AA-safety rule. Algorithms
  were studied and re-implemented for this engine, not copied.
- **EA's official open-source releases** —
  [CnC_Red_Alert](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert) (the
  Expert AI in `HOUSE.CPP`: urgency systems, superweapon handling, the
  fire-sale) and
  [CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour)
  (skirmish AI pacing and superweapon coordination). Releasing these was a
  gift to the community; this project mined them gratefully.
- **The retail `aimd.ini`** — Westwood's own AI designers authored the 132
  attack teams and 165 triggers our bots now field. Their designers wrote
  those; the bot just had to use them.

**The reference keepers**
- **[ModEnc](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com)** — the C&C modding
  encyclopedia; the semantics of every ini key, script action, and AI knob
  used here were verified against it.
- **[CNCMaps / ccmaps-net](https://github.com/zzattack/ccmaps-net)** by
  **zzattack** — the rendering reference used to verify VXL parsing and
  reconstruct retail lighting math (`Palette.ApplyLighting`).
- **[Project Perfect Mod](https://www.ppmsite.com)** and **DeeZire's RA2/YR
  INI Editing Guide** — decades of community documentation on how this game
  actually works.
- **[CnCNet](https://cncnet.org)** and the wider C&C community — for keeping
  these games alive for 25 years.

**The tools**
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org), [React](https://react.dev),
  [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Bun](https://bun.sh),
  [@timohausmann/quadtree-ts](https://github.com/timohausmann/quadtree-ts),
  [js-logger](https://github.com/jonnyreeves/js-logger), and
  [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) (the WASM build powers in-browser archive
  import).
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Gemini and GPT — see
  [AI-USE.md](AI-USE.md) for the split. Claude Code did the
  engineering.

**The originators**

This is a non-profit fan project, not affiliated with Electronic Arts Inc.
No copyright infringement is intended; all rights are held by their
respective owners. The engine this builds on is published under GPL-3.0 (see
Licence above), while the Chrono Divide/RA2WEB lineage it descends from states
that its engine reconstruction remains the author's and that commercial use is
prohibited. This project is non-commercial and takes no position between them.

No retail game assets are distributed with this repository. A legally-owned
copy of Red Alert 2 + Yuri's Revenge is required, and the import script only
ever reads from *your* install.

One file is inherited from the upstream base: `redalert2/public/res/ra2cd.mix`,
a 117 KB archive of 25 small members that the engine loads unconditionally at
boot. Upstream's `ini.mix` bundle was removed here after verifying the local
boot path never reads it. If you are a rights holder and would like anything
here changed or removed, open an issue and it will be handled immediately.
